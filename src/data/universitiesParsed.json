Student-heavy (~150,000+ across unis), international (tourists/expats everywhere), chaotic yet romantic—walkable historic center, excellent public transport (metro/buses/trams), but crowded/expensive housing. Iconic for history/culture lovers; daily life mixes ancient vibes with modern energy (events, festivals like Estate Romana).

Vast programs (hundreds in Italian + many English), historic campuses in Rome's heart (immersive cultural experience), international focus (thousands of foreign students), no/low tuition for many, scholarships/regional aid available. Ideal for humanities, classics, sciences, engineering, with Rome's unbeatable location for internships (UN agencies, embassies, tourism/tech). Affordable public uni with high prestige; great for history/art/archaeology lovers.",
